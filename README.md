# Investigate-the-Efficiency-of-K-Means-Outlier-Removal-KMOR-Algorithm

Hello! As part of my UG Research Paper, I investigated on the Efficiency of K-Means Outlier Removal KMOR Algorithm against modified KMOR algorithm with the improvement of mahalanobis distance in the place of eclidean distance for data points clustering, that is followed by the application of ESVA-LCPSD algorithm to detect the outliers.
